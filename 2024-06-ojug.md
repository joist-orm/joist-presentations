# Joist

Maybe the Best ORM, ever?

---

# Goals

1) Convince you to use Joist for your next backend 
   * ...even if it means switching to TypeScript
1) Learn some neat JavaScript & TypeScript tricks

---

# Agenda

* Flavors of ORMs
* Compare/Contract JPA & Joist
* Drill into "the best ever" claims
  * Bulletproof N+1s
  * Reactive Business Logic
  * Consistent Worldview

---

# ORM Flavors

1) Query builders to issue individual SQL statements
   - Java: JOOQ
   - JavaScript: Prisma, Drizzle, Keysely
2) Entity domain models that organize your business logic
   - Java: Hibernate/JPA
   - JavaScript: TypeORM, MikroORM, Joist

* If you use 1, you'll build 2 adhoc (Phil Greenspun's 10th rule)

---

# Compare & Contract

- Defining an entity
- Saving an entity
- Querying an entity

---

# Intro to an Entity - JPA

```java
@Entity public class Author {
   @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Long id;

   private String name;

   @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private List<Book> books;
}
```

* `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` non-feature rant
   - Assumes a globally-correct answer
   - Extremely different runtime semantics, but opaque to caller

---

# Intro to an Entity - Joist

```ts
import { AuthorCodegen } from "./entities";

class Author extends AuthorCodegen {
}
```

1) Rails/ActiveRecord-inspired minimalism
   - The database schema is source-of-truth
   - Don't repeat "the OneToMany incantation"
1) Code generation FTW
   - `yarn joist-codegen`

---

# Intro to Saving - JPA

```java
@Transactional
public void addBookToAuthor(Long authorId, String bookTitle) {
  Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, authorId);
  Book book = new Book();
  book.setTitle(bookTitle);
  book.setAuthor(author);
  author.books.add(book);
} 
```

- Diffs are tracked automatically
- `@Transactional` kicks off the flush 

---

# Intro to Saving - Joist

```ts
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
em.create(Book, { title: "b1", author });
em.flush();
```

- `em.flush` diffs all loaded entities
- Issues batch `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` in a transaction

---

# Simple Finding - Joist

```ts
const authors = await em.find(Author, {
  publisher: { country: "US" },
  firstName: { ne: "Bob" },
  age: { gt: 25 },
});
```

- Inline conditions are all `AND`s
- Type-checked against an `AuthorFilter` codegen type

---

# Complex Conditions - JPA

```java
var cb = session.getCriteriaBuilder();
var cq = cb.createQuery(Author.class);
var a = cq.from(Author.class);
var johnOver30 = cb.and(
    cb.equal(a.get("name"), "John Doe"),
    cb.gt(a.get("age"), 30)
);
var janeUnder25 = cb.and(
    cb.equal(a.get("name"), "Jane Smith"),
    cb.lt(a.get("age"), 25)
);
cq.where(cb.or(johnOver30, janeUnder25));
var authors = session.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
```
---

# Complex Conditions - Joist

```typescript
const a = alias(Author);
const johnOver30 = { and: [a.name.eq("John Doe"), a.age.gt(30)] };
const janeUnder25 = { and: [a.name.eq("Jane Smith"), a.age.lt(25)] };
const authors = await em.find(
  Author,
  { as: a, publisher: { country: "US" } },
  { conditions: { or: [johnOver30, janeUnder25] } }
);
```

- Type-checked against an `Alias<Author>` type

---

# N+1s

Joist's 1st "best ever" claim

---

# N+1s: JPA

```java
var authors = session.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a", Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  for (Book book : author.getBooks()) { // Is author.books in memory? No, load it
    for (Review review : book.getReviews()) {
      console.log(author.getName(), book.getTitle(), review.getContent());
    }
  }
}
```

- By default triggers N+1s
- N+1s on each `author.getBook()` or `book.getReviews()` invocation
  - `SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id = 1`
  - `SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id = 2`

---

# N+1s: JPA Populate Hint

```java
var authors = session.createQuery(
  "SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.books b JOIN FETCH b.reviews r",
  Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  for (Book book : author.getBooks()) { // Already in-memory
    for (Review review : book.getReviews()) {
      console.log(author.getName(), book.getTitle(), review.getContent());
    }
  }
}
```

- Tell the query to preload books & reviews
- Avoids N+1s...once you know what to do

---

# N+1s: JPA Whack-a-Mole Hints

```java
var authors = session.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a", Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  // ...what happens inside here? ðŸ¤ž
  applyAuthorBusinessLogic(author);
}
```

* The point of ORMs is writing logic in our preferred language
* But once we do so, we suffer a leaky abstraction and cause N+1
  - Any "load inside a loop" must be "hoisted & hinted"
* Game of "N+1 whack-a-mole"
  - Applies to Rails/ActiveRecord, basically all ORMs

---

# N+1s: Joist

- First ORM to fundamentally solve N+1s
- Because JavaScript is single threaded

---

# N+1s: Joist with async

```typescript
const authors = await em.find(Author, {});
await Promise.all(authors.map(async (author) => {
  const books = await author.books.load();
  await Promise.all(books.map(async (book) => {
    const reviews = await book.reviews.load();
    reviews.forEach(review => {
      console.log(author.name, book.title, review.content)
    });
  }));
}));
```

* No N+1s
* But all this `await` & `Promise.all` gunk

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

```ts
await Promise.all(authors.map(async (author) => {
 const books = await author.books.load();
 console.log(books);
}));
```

Seems like the flow is

* `a1.books.load()`, wait, then `console.log`
* `a2.books.load()`, wait, then `console.log`
* So do the "complete work" of each iteration

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

```ts
await Promise.all(authors.map(handleAuthor));
function handleAuthor(author) { // part 1
  return author.books.load().then(handleBooks);
}
function handleBooks(books) { // part 2
  console.log(books);
}
```

* Call `handleAuthor(a1)`, call `a1.books.load().then(...)`, return
* Call `handleAuthor(a2)`, call `a2.books.load().then(...)`, return
* How many authors need books? `[a1, a2]` in one `SELECT` call
* After batch `SELECT` comes back, invoke the `handleBooks`

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

* Creates "waves" of data loading
* Load books ... for all 50 authors (part 1)
* Load reviews ... for all 100 books (part 2)
* Courtesy of Facebook https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
  * Uses "ticks" of the event loop
  * Like a `setTimeout(0, actuallyLoadNow())`

---

# N+1s: Agnostic to Program Structure

```ts
class Author extends AuthorCodegen {}

config.addRule("books", a => {
  if (a.books.get.length > 10) {
    return "Cannot have more than 10 books";
  }
})
```

* Evaluating this rule on 100 authors doesn't N+1
* All rules/hooks create adhoc, emergent "waves" of loading
* Freedom from "hoist & hint"

---

# N+1s: Pros/Cons of await

* We will never `N+1`
* But the `await` gunk sucks

  ```typescript
  const authors = await em.find(Author, {});
  await Promise.all(authors.map(async (author) => {
    const books = await author.books.load();
    await Promise.all(books.map(async (book) => {
      const reviews = await book.reviews.load();
      reviews.forEach(review => {
        console.log(author.name, book.title, review.content)
      });
    }));
  }));
  ```

---

# N+1s: Joist w/Populate Hints

```typescript
const authors = await em.find(Author, {}, {
  populate: { books: "reviews" }
})
authors.forEach((author) => {
  author.books.get.forEach((book) => {
    book.reviews.get.forEach(review => {
      console.log(author.name, book.title, review.content);
    });
  });
});
```

- Ability to call `.get`--no `await`
- `populate` hints are for **code clarity, not N+1 prevention**

---

# TypeScript Magic: Loaded Types

```typescript
const a1: Author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
// Compile error, `.get` is not available
console.log(a1.books.get);

const a2: Loaded<Author, { books: "reviews" }> =
  await em.load(Author, "a:2", { books: "reviews" });
console.log(a2.books.get[0].reviews.get[0].title);
```

- Tracking "loaded-ness" in the type system

---

# TypeScript Magic: Loaded Types

```typescript
// Loaded<Author, { books: "reviews" }>[]
const authors = await em.find(
  Author, {}, { populate: { books: "reviews" } }
);

// Did we populate enough?
authors.forEach((author) => applyAuthorBusinessLogic(author));

function applyAuthorBusinessLogic(
  author: Loaded<Author, { books: "reviews", publisher: {} }>
) {
  console.log(author.books.get.length);
  console.log(author.publisher.get.name);
}
```

---

# TypeScript Magic: Loaded Types

```java
class Utils {
  public static <T> Box<T> createBox(T value) {
    return new Box<>(value);
  }
}

// will be Box<Integer>
var intBox = Utils.createBox(123);
// will be Box<String>
var strBox = Utils.createBox("Hello, World!");
```

- Use type inference to guess "what is `T`"

---

# TypeScript Magic: Loaded Types

```ts
class Book {}
class Author { books: Relation<Book[]> = hasMany(); }
type Relation<T> = { load(): Promise<T> };

type Loaded<T, H extends keyof T> = {
  [K in keyof T]:
    K extends H
     ? (T[K] extends { load(): Promise<infer U> } ? { get: U } : never)
     : never;
} & T;

function find<T, H>(cstr: Constructor<T>, hint: H): Promise<Loaded<T, H>> {}
const a1: Loaded<Author, "books"> = await em.find(Author, "books");
console.log(a1.books.get[0].title);
```

---

# N+1s: Wrap Up

- Solved N+1s with the JavaScript Event Loop
- Added a `Loaded` escape-hatch for great TypeScript DX

---

# Reactivity

* When `Author.firstName` changes, "do stuff"
* Re-run validation rules that depend on it
* Re-calculate derived fields that depend on it

---

# Reactivity

- First ORM to implement "backend reactivity"

---

# Reactivity: Validation Rules

```ts
// Author.ts
import { authorConfig as config } from "./entities";

config.addRule({ firstName: {}, books: "title" }, (a) => {
  if (a.books.get.find((b) => b.title === a.firstName)) {
    return "A book title cannot be the author's firstName";
  }
});
```

- Runs on `Author.firstName` change
- Runs any `Book.title` change
- Runs any `Author.books` add/remove/delete

---

# Reactivity: Declarative

- Similar productivity shift from:
    - Imperative "spaghetti code" event callbacks in jQuery, to
    - Declarative "computeds" of signals/observables

---

# Reactivity: Derived Fields

```ts
class Author extends AuthorCodegen {
  readonly numberOfBooks: ReactiveField<Author, number> = hasReactiveField(
    "numberOfBooks",
    ["books"],
    (a) => a.books.get.length,
  );
}
```

- Nested hints/subgraphs, i.e. `{ books: { comments: "user" } }`

---

# Reactivity: Consistent Views

```ts
const a1 = em.load(Author, "a:1", "numberOfBooks");
em.create(Book, { author: a1, title: "b1" });
expect(a1.numberOfBooks.get).toBe(1);

const a2 = em.load(Author, "a:2");
em.create(Book, { author: a2, title: "b2" });
expect(await a1.numberOfBooks.load()).toBe(1);
```

- Any WIP/uncommitted mutations are immediately visible 
- Business logic never has to worry about stale values

---

# Reactivity: How it Works

```ts
// Starting at BookReview, given a hint of review -> book -> author
const hint = { book: { title: {}, author: ["firstName", "lastName"] } };
const reversePaths = reverse(BookReview, BookReview, hint);
expect(reversePaths).toEqual([
  // Any new BookReview, invoke rule
  { entity: "BookReview", fields: [], path: [] },
  // Any Book title/author change, load book.reviews, invoke rule
  { entity: "Book", fields: ["title", "author"], path: ["reviews"] },
  // Any Author firstName/lastName change, load author.books + book.reviews, invoke rule
  { entity: "Author", fields: ["firstName", "lastName"], path: ["books", "reviews"] },
]);
```

- Reverse graph traversal

---

# Reactivity: ...and also lifecycle hooks

- Stereotypical `beforeUpdate`, `beforeCreate`, `beforeDelete`
- Attempting to replace as many "imperative hook" patterns with "declarative" reactive features

---

# Conclusion

* JavaScript is extremely good at preventing N+1s
  - Courtesy of single-threaded & Dataloader
* TypeScript is extremely good at "thinking in subgraphs"
    - Courtesy of mapped & conditional types
* Joist leverages both to be maybe the Best ORM ever
