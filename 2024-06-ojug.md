# Joist

Maybe the Best ORM, ever?

---

# Goals

1) Convince you to use Joist for your next backend 
   * ...even if it means switching to TypeScript
1) Learn some neat JavaScript & TypeScript tricks

---

# Agenda

* Flavors of ORMs
* Compare/Contract JPA & Joist
* Drill into "the best ever" claims
  * Bulletproof N+1s
  * Reactive Business Logic
  * Consistent Worldview

---

# ORM Flavors

1) Query builders that construct individual SQL statements
   * Java: JOOQ
   * JavaScript: Prisma, Drizzle, Keysely
2) Entity frameworks that organize your business logic
   * Java: Hibernate/JPA
   * JavaScript: TypeORM, MikroORM, Joist

* If you use 1, you'll build 2 adhoc (Phil Greenspun's 10th rule)

---

# Compare & Contract

* Defining an entity
* Saving an entity
* Querying an entity

---

# Intro to an Entity - JPA

```java
@Entity public class Author {
   @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Long id;

   private String name;

   @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private List<Book> books;
}
```

* `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` non-feature rant
   * Assumes a globally-correct answer
   * Extremely different runtime semantics, but opaque to caller

---

# Intro to an Entity - Joist

```ts
import { AuthorCodegen } from "./entities";

class Author extends AuthorCodegen {
}
```

1) Rails/ActiveRecord-inspired minimalism
   * The database schema is source-of-truth
   * Don't repeat "the OneToMany incantation"
1) Code generation FTW
   * `yarn joist-codegen`

---

# Intro to Saving - JPA

```java
@Transactional
public void addBookToAuthor(Long authorId, String bookTitle) {
  Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, authorId);
  Book book = new Book();
  book.setTitle(bookTitle);
  book.setAuthor(author);
  author.books.add(book);
} 
```

* Diffs are tracked automatically
* `@Transactional` kicks off the flush 

---

# Intro to Saving - Joist

```ts
const author = await em.load(Author, "a:1");
em.create(Book, { title: "b1", author });
new Book(em, { title: "b2", author });
em.flush();
```

* `em.flush` "diffs" all loaded entities
* Issues batch `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` in a transaction

---

# Simple Finding - Joist

```ts
const authors = await em.find(Author, {
  publisher: { country: "US" },
  firstName: { ne: "Bob" },
  age: { gt: 25 },
});
```

* Inline conditions are all `AND`s
* Type-checked against an `AuthorFilter` codegen type

---

# Complex Conditions - JPA

```java
var cb = session.getCriteriaBuilder();
var cq = cb.createQuery(Author.class);
var a = cq.from(Author.class);
var johnOver30 = cb.and(
    cb.equal(a.get("name"), "John Doe"),
    cb.gt(a.get("age"), 30)
);
var janeUnder25 = cb.and(
    cb.equal(a.get("name"), "Jane Smith"),
    cb.lt(a.get("age"), 25)
);
cq.where(cb.or(johnOver30, janeUnder25));
var authors = session.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
```
---

# Complex Conditions - Joist

```typescript
const a = alias(Author);
const johnOver30 = { and: [a.name.eq("John Doe"), a.age.gt(30)] };
const janeUnder25 = { and: [a.name.eq("Jane Smith"), a.age.lt(25)] };
const authors = await em.find(
  Author,
  { as: a, publisher: { country: "US" } },
  { conditions: { or: [johnOver30, janeUnder25] } }
);
```

* Type-checked against an `Alias<Author>` type

---

# N+1s

Joist's 1st "best ever" claim

---

# N+1s: JPA

```java
var authors = session.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a", Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  for (Book book : author.getBooks()) { // Is author.books in memory? No, load it
    for (Review review : book.getReviews()) {
      console.log(author.getName(), book.getTitle(), review.getContent());
    }
  }
}
```

* By default triggers N+1s
* N+1s on each `author.getBook()` or `book.getReviews()` invocation
  * `SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id = 1`
  * `SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id = 2`

---

# N+1s: JPA Populate Hint

```java
var authors = session.createQuery(
  "SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.books b JOIN FETCH b.reviews r",
  Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  for (Book book : author.getBooks()) { // Already in-memory
    for (Review review : book.getReviews()) {
      console.log(author.getName(), book.getTitle(), review.getContent());
    }
  }
}
```

* Tell the query to preload books & reviews
* Avoids N+1s...once you know what to do

---

# N+1s: JPA Whack-a-Mole Hints

```java
var authors = session.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a", Author.class).getResultList();
for (Author author : authors) {
  // ...what happens inside here? ðŸ¤ž
  applyAuthorBusinessLogic(author);
}
```

* The point of ORMs is writing logic in our preferred language
* But once we do so, we suffer a leaky abstraction and cause N+1
* Game of "N+1 whack-a-mole"
  * Applies to Rails/ActiveRecord, basically all ORMs

---

# N+1s: Joist

* First ORM to solve N+1s
* Because JavaScript is single threaded

---

# N+1s: Joist with async

```typescript
const authors = await em.find(Author, {});
await Promise.all(authors.map(async (author) => {
  const books = await author.books.load();
  await Promise.all(books.map(async (book) => {
    const reviews = await book.reviews.load();
    reviews.forEach(review => {
      console.log(author.name, book.title, review.content)
    });
  }));
}));
```

* No N+1s
* But all this `await` & `Promise.all` gunk

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

```ts
await Promise.all(authors.map(async (author) => {
 const books = await author.books.load();
 console.log(books);
}));
```

Seems like the flow is

* `a1.books.load()`, wait, then `console.log`
* `a2.books.load()`, wait, then `console.log`

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

```ts
await Promise.all(authors.map(handleAuthor));
function handleAuthor(author) {
  return author.books.load().then((books) => { // part 1
    console.log(books);// part 2
  });
}
```

Actual flow is

* Call `handleAuthor(a1)`, ask for `a1.books.load`, enqueue
* Call `handleAuthor(a2)`, ask for `a2.books.load`, enqueue
* Invokes "part 1" of `handleAuthor` for all authors, synchronously

---

# N+1s: Event loop & dataloader

* Creates "waves" of data loading
* Load books ... for all 50 authors (part 1)
* Load reviews ... for all 100 books (part 2)
* Courtesy of Facebook https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
  * Uses "ticks" of the event loop

---

# N+1s: Agnostic to Program Structure

```ts
class Author extends AuthorCodegen {}

config.addRule("books", a => {
  if (a.books.get.length > 10) {
    return "Cannot have more than 10 books";
  }
})
```

* Evaluating this rule on 100 authors doesn't N+1
* All rules/hooks create adhoc "waves" of loading

---

# N+1s: Pros/Cons of await

* We will never `N+1`
* But the `await` gunk sucks

---

# N+1s: Joist w/Populate Hints

```typescript
const authors = await em.find(Author, {}, {
  populate: { books: "reviews" }
})
authors.forEach((author) => {
  author.books.get.forEach((book) => {
    book.reviews.get.forEach(review => {
      console.log(author.name, book.title, review.content);
    });
  });
});
```

* Ability to call `.get`--no `await`

---

# N+1s: Joist ...why bother?

* We're back to "to be as clean as JPA"
* But we "need" the up-front `populate` hint
* `populate` hints are for **code clarity, not N+1 prevention**

---

# N+1s: Loaded-ness via Types

```typescript
// Loaded<Author, { books: "reviews" }>
const authors = await em.find(
  Author, {}, { populate: { books: "reviews" } }
);

// Did we populate enough?
authors.forEach((author) => applyAuthorBusinessLogic(author));

function applyAuthorBusinessLogic(
  author: Loaded<Author, { books: "reviews", publisher: {} }>
) {
  console.log(author.books.get.length);
  console.log(author.publisher.get.name);
}
```

---

# N+1s: Loaded-ness via Types

```java
class Utils {
  public static <T> Box<T> createBox(T value) {
    return new Box<>(value);
  }
}

// will be Box<Integer>
var intBox = Utils.createBox(123);
// will be Box<String>
var strBox = Utils.createBox("Hello, World!");
```

---

# N+1s: Loaded Types Magic

```ts
type Relation<T> = { load(): Promise<T> };

class Book {}
class Author { books: Relation<Book[]> = null!; }

type Loaded<T, H extends keyof T> = {
  [K in keyof T]:
    K extends H
     ? (T[K] extends { load(): Promise<infer U> } ? { get: U } : never)
     : never;
} & T;

const a1: Loaded<Author, "books"> = null!;
console.log(a1.books.get);
```

---

# N+1s

---

# Reactivity

* When `Author.firstName` changes, "do stuff"
* Re-run valiation rules that depend on it
* Re-calculate derived fields that depend on it

# Reactivity: Joist

* First ORM to implement backend reactivity

# Reactivity: Validation Rules


---

# Conclusion

* JavaScript is extremely good at preventing N+1s
* TypeScript is extremely good at "thinking in subgraphs"
* Joist leverages both to
